		<h1>Welcome to Jade Dragon!</h1>
        <h2>Our story:</h2>
        <p>When Yan and Steve decided to open a restaurant, one thing they needed 
        to choose was what to use fora name. The inspirations of our lives are our 
        daughters, Lulu and CeeCee. Lulu's name means Jade and CeeCee's 
        Chinese sign is the Dragon, so it was easy to combine them into the Jade 
        Dragon.</p>

        <p>Our family and our staff hope that your dining experience here meets all 
        your expectations. If there is anything that we can do to make it Getter, 
        let one ofus know and we will do what we can to accommodate you.</p>

        <p>We truly consider theJade Dragon a community restaurant. We are your 
        neighbors, classmates andfilends. We hire people from the community, 
        participate in community events, and most importantly serve to our 
        community what is considered the best Chinese food in the area. All 
        of the food we serve is made to order using thefreshest ingredients and 
        skillfid preparation. Many of our dishes you can't find anywhere else 
        because the are our own creations or twists on traditional favorites. We 
        work hard to bring the taste of China to you and to stand outfrom other 
        Chinese restaurants.</p>

        <p>Many of our patrons come here as customers and leave as friends. We 
        try to talk to our customers while they are here and make them feel very 
        comfortable and want to return again. Yes, we are in the restaurant 
        business to provide a living for us and our staff; but more importantly we 
        are here to make friends and make them happy.</p>

        <p>Thank you for your continued patronage,</p>

        <p><strong>Yan, Steve, CeeCee and Lulu</strong><p>
